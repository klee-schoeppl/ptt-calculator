# Dice Task Calculations
Automated analysis of dice tasks for studies on reasoning under uncertainty. Written as research assistant on BMBF project &lt;01UL1906X> "Logic and philosophy of science of reasoning under uncertainty".

This R-subroutine calculates and prints the uncertainty intervals identified by different interpretations of natural language conditionals in dice tasks. In addition, it calculates the connection between antecedent and consequent in terms of different notions of argument strength.

For more detailed explanations and application examples, see the works of Dr.Dr. Niki Pfeifer.
